# Uncertainty

Physics is the study of the laws of nature through observation and experiment. In an experiment, we perform measurements and collect data, then we interpret the data and derive trends and relationships between our variables.

When we measure a quantity, say the length of a pendulum, we will never be able to measure the **true value** of the length. Instead, if we are careful and thoughtful in our measurement, we will get a length close to the true length, our **best estimate**. 

The most honest way to report our measurement to others is to provide our best estimate and a window of values in which the true length might fall. This window is called our **uncertainty**. We would typically write down the length of the pendulum in the following format.

$$
60.23 \pm 0.05 \text{ cm}
$$

The 60.23 cm is our best estimate, and the 0.05 cm is our estimate of the uncertainty.  We are saying that our best guess at the true length of the rod is 60.23 cm but the true length is most likely between 60.18 cm and 60.28 cm.

:::Note
**Uncertainty is unavoidable in every measurement**
:::

Typically, the uncertainty comes from two sources, systematic and random uncertainty. 

## Systematic Uncertainty

**Systematic Uncertainty** causes the measurement to consistently be high or low. Systematic uncertainty usually arises from measurement technique or other physical influences, for example improperly calibrating an instrument or assuming a variable is negligible. The job of the experimenter is to minimize the systematic error and eliminate it if possible. 

## Random Uncertainty
