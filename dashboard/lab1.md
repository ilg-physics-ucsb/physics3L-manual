# Pendulum

:::Intro (Objective)
The objective of this lab is to determine which physical quantities influence the period of a pendulum. The relevant features are the mass of the bob, the length of the pendulum, and the initial angular displacement. By making many measurements of each feature while keeping the other two constant you will construct an argument as to which feature or features influence the period.

# Introduction

## Apparatus

:::Figure (fullApparatus|m|R)
![Picture of the apparatus. Has a metal bar vertically clamped to a table. At the top of the bar clamped on is another bar that is orthogonal to the original. Clamped to the horizontal bar is a large wooden protractor. In front of the protractor is a string goes through a hole in the horizontal bar. In the middle of the vertical rod is a piece of plastic that is used to adjust the length of the string.](imgs/Lab1/FullApparatus.jpg "Fully Constructed Pendulum Apparatus (Click on me to see a larger version)")

In [](Figure-fullApparatus) you see a picture of the apparatus you will be using. When you come in it will be setup as shown. One the table, as seen in [](Figure-equipment).D will be a container that should have a stopwatch, a metric measuring tape, and 6 bobs of the same size but made of different materials. The materials are wood, aluminum, brass, copper, steel, and zinc. Everything can be seen more clearly in [](Figure-equipment).

You can use the stopwatch to measure the period. 

To test mass you can switch which bob is at the end of the pendulum by pushing the paperclip at the end of the string through the bob. You can use the balance to measure the mass

To read your initial angle a protractor is attached to the setup.

To adjust the length you will use piece of plastic attached to the vertical steel pole. To use it, just squeeze the handles together and slide it up and down the pole. The length of the pendulum can be adjust from about 20 cm to 160 cm. You can use the measuring tape to precisely measure the length. 

Watch the video below for instructions on how to use the apparatus.

## Pre-Lab

:::Activity
Write a three part procedure for collecting your data to measure each parameter independently. Your procedure should be identify each step you will need to take and should not be as vague as:
1. Measure two periods at two lengths with set mass and initial angle.
2. Measure two periods at two angles with set mass and length.
3. Measure two peiods at two masses with set length and initial angle.

You should expand on each of these and go into the details of each one. Approximately X-X steps should be appropriate.
